    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p id="p1">My name is Camden and I was born and raised in Jamestown Nd. I have two older sisters, and to stay busy during the summer I ran my own lawn care business with me and my dad.</p>
    <p id="p2">Some of my hobbies include camping with my family, fishing, playing video games, and frisbee golfing. I graduated from Jamestown High School in 2022 and while I was there my average GPA was a 3.2 and I played many sports such as football and baskeball and I ran track and cross country.</p>
